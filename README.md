# streamlings
A little pet that lives on your stream and responds to chat. It's like a Tamagotchi powered by your audience.

## Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

## Testing

All tests run automatically on push/PR via GitHub Actions.

To run tests locally:

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm --filter @streamlings/worker test

# Watch mode
pnpm --filter @streamlings/worker test:watch
```

### Branch Protection

To enforce tests on the `main` branch:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches** → **Add branch protection rule**
2. Branch name pattern: `main`
3. Enable: **Require status checks to pass before merging**
4. Select status check: **test**
5. Save changes

This ensures all tests must pass before code can be merged to main.

### Devlog
- installed the [Twitch CLI](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/cli/), mostly so that I can emulate incoming [EventSubs](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub/).
- installed the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) so that we can develop Workers locally (and eventually deploy).
- initialized two apps: a Web app, which will serve as the user-facing management application, and a Worker, which will house streamling state, connect to Twitch, etc. Unsure when to split this up, but right now the simplest thing to do is keep it as one worker. Both were initialized via their respective CLIs, no other changes made.
