# streamlings
A little pet that lives on your stream and responds to chat. Itâ€™s like a Tamagotchi powered by your audience.

### Devlog
- installed the [Twitch CLI](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/cli/), mostly so that I can emulate incoming [EventSubs](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/eventsub/).
- installed the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) so that we can develop Workers locally (and eventually deploy).
