# False Positives

When the automated reviewer flags something incorrectly, add it here so the same mistake isn't repeated. This file is included in the review prompt.

## Format

Each entry should describe the pattern that was incorrectly flagged and why it's actually fine:

```
### [Short description]
The reviewer flagged [what it flagged] because [why it thought it was wrong].
This is acceptable because [why it's actually fine].
```
